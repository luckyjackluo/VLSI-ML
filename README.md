# VLSI-ML

Developing Machine Learning pipeline and toolkit for VLSI circuits.
Including:
- Extracting VLSI circuits to Pytorch dataset based on OpenRoad package.
- ML models to predict VLSI circuits' global properties.
- GNN models to predict VLSI circuits' local properties.
- GNN models to predict VLSI circuits' best qualities based on given design and technology node.

This pipeline can be combine with another tool:
VLSI-TDA: Topological Data Analysis tool for VLSI circuits.

Currently also support running on SDSC Expanse or TSCC clusters.
